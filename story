cap seller fell asleep under a tree. monkeys saw caps and wore them. when cap seller got up he saw there were no caps.
he heard some noise. he looked up.
So seller got an idea. he saw that monkeys were imitating him.
So he made monkeys throw the caps down.
He happily picked all of them and went.
monkeys left the tree.
